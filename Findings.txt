
Here's a suggested structure for your documentation, along with some key points to include:

**1. Introduction**

*   **Purpose:** Briefly explain the purpose of the `csrf_scanner.py` script and the CSRF vulnerability it aims to detect.
*   **Scope:** Define the scope of the script, such as the types of web applications it can scan and any limitations.

**2. Usage Instructions**

*   **Prerequisites:** List any prerequisites, such as Python and the required libraries (`requests`, `beautifulsoup4`).
*   **Installation:** Provide clear instructions on how to install the necessary libraries using `pip`.
*   **Running the Script:** Explain how to execute the script from the command line, including how to provide the target URL.
*   **Output:** Describe the format of the script's output and how to interpret the results.

**3. Code Explanation**

*   **`scan_for_csrf` function:** Provide a detailed explanation of how this function works, including:
    *   Fetching the web page using the `requests` library.
    *   Parsing the HTML content using `BeautifulSoup`.
    *   Identifying forms and checking for the presence of CSRF tokens.
    *   Extracting relevant information from the forms (action URL, form HTML).
*   **Error Handling:** Explain how the script handles potential errors, such as network issues or invalid URLs.

**4.  Limitations and Future Improvements**

*   **False Positives/Negatives:** Discuss the potential for the script to generate false positives or false negatives and any factors that might contribute to this.
*   **Advanced Techniques:**  Mention any advanced CSRF attack techniques that the script doesn't currently address.
*   **Ideas for Enhancement:** Suggest potential improvements, such as adding checks for specific types of forms or actions, implementing more sophisticated parsing techniques, or integrating with other security tools.

**5. Proof of Concept (PoC)**

*   Include the HTML code for the generic CSRF PoC.
*   Explain how to adapt the PoC to target a specific vulnerable form.
*   Emphasize the importance of ethical testing and obtaining proper authorization.
